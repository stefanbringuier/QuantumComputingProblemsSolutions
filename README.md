My alternative solutions to problems in the book *Problems and solutions in quantum computing and quantum information*<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>
 using Julia with [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl) within [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks.

I put together a static website of the notebooks using [Franklin.jl](franklinjl.org) and deployed with github pages. Its still in an early state:

ðŸŽˆ[Static Pluto Notebook Website](https://stefanbringuier.github.io/QuantumComputingProblemsSolutions/index.html)ðŸŽˆ


Environment and pluto server can be instatiated from the Package.toml and dependencies from Manifest.toml, using the command line:

```bash
julia --project=@. -e "using Pluto; Pluto.run()"
```

A `test/runtests.jl` file exist which just runs each notebook file is include but may or may not be useful.
